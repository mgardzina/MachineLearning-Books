Based on the contents of your folder, I can provide a description of your workspace:
This appears to be a comprehensive machine learning and artificial intelligence learning repository containing a mix of educational materials and practical exercises. The content is organized in a sequential learning path, starting from basic concepts and progressing to more advanced topics. Here's a breakdown:
Learning Materials:
PDF presentations covering fundamental topics like AI introduction, neural networks, CNNs, transformers, NLP, and large language models
Several research papers and technical reports (DeepSeek, janus_pro_tech_report, lbdl)
Practical Exercises (Jupyter Notebooks):
Python basics (02_wstep_do_pythona.ipynb)
NumPy and matrix operations (00_numpy_wektory_macierze.ipynb)
Machine Learning introduction (03_ml_intro.ipynb)
Linear Regression (04_regresja_liniowa.ipynb)
Logistic Regression (06_regresja_logistyczna.ipynb)
Neural Networks and Deep Learning:
Logistic Regression with Neural Networks (06.2_regresja_logistyczna_nn.ipynb)
Gradient Descent (07_gradient_descent.ipynb)
PyTorch CNN implementation (08_pytorch_CNN.ipynb)
Word Embeddings (09_word_embeddings.ipynb)
Project Structure:
Uses a Python virtual environment (.venv directory)
Version controlled with Git (.git directory)
Contains some data files (e.g., my_array.npy)
Includes an IDE configuration (.idea directory)
The materials appear to be in Polish (based on file names) and follow a well-structured learning path from basic concepts to advanced topics in machine learning and deep learning. The combination of theoretical PDFs and practical Jupyter notebooks suggests a hands-on approach to learning these topics.
